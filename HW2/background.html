<p> Our Background: </p>
    <p> Antonio's Grocery Store has been open since the early 1900's and was started by his grandfather who came here from Italy. Growing up, Antonio was always on the farm, helping his father and grandfather take care of animals, crops, and so on. He continues his grandfathers legacy and hopes to pass down this business onto his future family. </p>
